## coingame
A small game about taking coins.

# How to Play
The game starts with an n-long row of coins. Players take turns to take a coin from the row. When taking a coin, the player also takes the coin to either side of it (e.g. if one takes the fourth coin, they also take the third and fifth). The last player to take a coin wins.

# Strategy
This Haskell version was mostly made both as Haskell practice and to write some computer players, in order to see if coingame is solvable.
